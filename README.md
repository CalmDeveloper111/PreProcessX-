From Messy to Managed: Data Preprocessing for Better Insights

**Description :**

Process begins with the collection of raw data, followed by a series of preprocessing steps designed to clean, transform, and prepare the data for analysis. Techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, feature extraction, and handling missing values are employed to ensure data integrity and usability.


**Installation :**

    Clone the Repository

     ```sh
       https://github.com/CalmDeveloper111/PreProcessX-.git     
     ```    

**Usage :**

    i.  Open the project directory:
      -  First, open your project directory in a code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm).

    ii.  Start the Development Server:
             - Open the terminal in your code editor or a separate terminal window.
             - Run the following command to start the Django development server:
               ```sh
               python manage.py runserver
              ```
    iii. Access the Web Interface:
               - Once the server is running, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. This will open the web interface of your application.
  
    iv.  Upload the File:
               - On the web interface, look for the file upload section.
               - Upload the file containing the information you want to analyze.
  
    v.   Submit the Information:
               - After uploading the file, click the "Submit" button to process the data.
  
    vi.  View Results:
               - Once the file is submitted, you will be able to view the results and analysis on the web interface.
